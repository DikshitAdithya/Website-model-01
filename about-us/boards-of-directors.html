<h4>Kenneth Code</h4>
<p>Founding Partner <br /> (Realterm Global)</p>
</div>
<div class="popdesc">
<div class="scroll">
<p>Mr. Code has worn many hats since 1990 and played key roles in the company’s foundational events. He brings more than 30 years of experience in virtually every aspect of real estate finance, acquisition, and development in both the public and private sectors to the job of CEO.</p>
<p>After control of the company was secured from First City Development, Mr. Code raised the first institutional capital for the company’s initial air cargo development in Montreal, Quebec. The acquisitions of Intermediate Terminals and Marathon Aviation Terminals were the basis for the creation of Realterm Logistics and Aeroterm. Mr. Code and John Cammett have been true partners in the building of Realterm, often interchangeably working deals, files and relationships. Since that initial investment, the company’s portfolio has expanded to more than 35 airports around the world. He has provided leadership and undertaken groundbreaking transactions for Realterm as it grew.</p>
<p>Since Realterm’s beginnings, Mr. Code has served as a catalyst for “stretch” events, always driven to see the company into its next iteration. These events include pushing to enter the U.S. marketplace in 1997, establishing joint ventures with institutional capital, the branding of Realterm with its expansion into India in 2006, the creation of IndoSpace and guiding the company toward a discretionary capital model for raising funds. Mr. Code has contributed to the company’s ongoing success by creating cultural and operational systems, while leveraging relationships and partnerships to help Realterm and its stakeholders raise funds and achieve long-term goals.</p>
<p>Mr. Code graduated from Harvard University with a BA in economics. He is a member of the ULI (Urban Land Institute) and PREA (Pension Real Estate Association). Mr. Code lives in Annapolis with his wife and they have four children. Outside the office he has devoted thousands of hours to the Navy Youth Hockey Association as coach and board member. He and his wife support The Avasara Academy in Pune, India through the Board of Leadership Foundation of India.</p>

<h4>John Cammett</h4>
<p>Founding Partner &amp; CEO (Aeroterm)</p>
</div>
<div class="popdesc">
<div class="scroll">Mr. Cammett, a lifelong entrepreneur who made his first deal at 23, boasts nearly 30 years of experience in all aspects of real estate, including finance, investment, management, and leasing. Since the early 1990s, Mr. Cammett has led the company as its portfolio of airport industrial real estate has grown to more than 35 airports. His unique capabilities as a problem solver help him offer creative solutions for clients, space users, regional airport authorities, and investors Mr. Cammett holds a bachelor’s degree in engineering and applied sciences from Harvard. He began his career developing residential and office space in New England during the 1980s. When that market shrunk, Mr. Cammett and his partner, Kenneth S. Code, struck out in a new direction. Seizing a new opportunity in a unique niche, in 1991 they signed their first ground lease to develop the next generation of air cargo village facilities for the Montreal, Quebec airport. Since then Mr. Cammett has overseen the company’s tremendous growth and he is currently responsible for day-to-day management of company operations, portfolio expansion, and new business initiatives. He firmly believes in working collaboratively to reach solutions; he attributes the company’s durability and flexibility to this overarching philosophy, which has led to successful long-term, serial business relationships. A believer in “win-win” scenarios, Mr. Cammett prides himself on listening closely to stakeholders, gaining a thorough grasp on their requirements, and understanding their whole project lifecycle. His approach is especially important when it comes to the public-private partnerships, especially with regional airport authorities, behind their airport cargo development projects. He applies his extensive private sector knowledge to public sector requirements, including all aspects of building, designing, financing, transferring, and managing transportation infrastructure. Mr. Cammett relishes the challenge of solving complex design and structure challenges. He takes great satisfaction in working with airports to provide the services they need for their business community and to make them competitive with the rest of the world. Mr. Cammett also sees his job as building not just physical structures but business opportunities. He focuses on establishing trust with investors, and has worked especially to attract more institutional investors. By identifying niche businesses and turning them into multi-billion dollar opportunities, the company has grown while helping its stakeholder and investors reach new levels of success. Highlights of Mr. Cammett’s career include overseeing a recent collateralized bond transaction of more than $425 million, involving more than 20 airport authorities. He is especially proud of the company’s successful work with renewable energy: through RealTerm Energy, the company has branched into providing energy-efficient, turnkey LED street lighting conversions, using 70% less energy, to more than 150 municipalities in North America. Mr. Cammett is a member of ACI (Airports Council International). He also serves on the national committee for JDRS, the leading global organization funding research into Type 1 diabetes. He lends his business expertise and support to new therapies and technologies to treat this disease. Mr. Cammett looks forward to further growth and new challenges - the more complex, the better.</div>
